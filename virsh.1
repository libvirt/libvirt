.IX Title "VIRSH 1"
.TH VIRSH 1 "2008-04-15" "perl v5.8.8" "Virtualization Support"
.SH "NAME"
virsh \- management user interface
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
virsh <subcommand> [args]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBvirsh\fR program is the main interface for managing virsh guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available under the \s-1GNU\s0 Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aim at providing long term stable C \s-1API\s0 initially for the Xen paravirtualization but should be able to integrate other virtualization mechanisms, it currently also support QEmu and \s-1KVM\s0.
.PP
The basic structure of most virsh usage is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  virsh <command> <domain-id> [OPTIONS]
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIcommand\fR is one of the commands listed below, \fIdomain-id\fR
is the numeric domain id, or the domain name (which will be internally
translated to domain id), and \fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR are command specific
options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule in the cases where
the command in question acts on all domains, the entire machine,
or directly on the xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions will be clear for
each of those commands.
.PP
The \fBvirsh\fR program can be used either to run one command at a time
by giving the command as an argument on the command line, or as a shell
if no command is given in the command line, it will then start a minimal
interpreter waiting for your commands and the \fBquit\fR command will then exit
the program.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
All \fBvirsh\fR operations rely upon the libvirt library.
For any virsh commands to run xend/qemu, or what ever virtual library that libvirt supports.  For this reason you should start xend/qemu as a service when your system first boots using xen/qemu. This can usually be done using the command
\&\fBservice start libvirtd\fR .
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands act asynchronously, so just because the \fBvirsh\fR
program returned, doesn't mean the action is complete.  This is
important, as many operations on domains, like create and shutdown,
can take considerable time (30 seconds or more) to bring the machine
into a fully compliant state.  If you want to know when one of these
actions has finished you must poll through virsh list periodically.
.SH "GENERIC COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERIC COMMANDS"

current Domain is in.
.RE
.IP "\fBr \- running\fR" 4
.IX Item "r - running"
The domain is currently running on a \s-1CPU\s0
.IP "\fBb \- blocked\fR" 4
.IX Item "b - blocked"
The domain is blocked, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused
because the domain is waiting on \s-1IO\s0 (a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP "\fBp \- paused\fR" 4
.IX Item "p - paused"
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBxm pause\fR.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for
scheduling by the Xen hypervisor.
.IP "\fBs \- shutdown\fR" 4
.IX Item "s - shutdown"
The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system
has been notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations
gracefully.
.IP "\fBc \- crashed\fR" 4
.IX Item "c - crashed"
The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually
this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to
restart on crash.  See xmdomain.cfg for more info.
.IP "\fBd \- dying\fR" 4
.IX Item "d - dying"
The domain is in process of dying, but hasn't completely shutdown or
crashed.
.RE
.RS 4
.SH "DOMAIN COMMANDS"
.IX Header "DOMAIN COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate domains directly, as stated
previously most commands take domain-id as the first parameter. The
\&\fIdomain-id\fR can be specified as an short integer, a name or a full \s-1UUID\s0.
.IP "\fBautostart\fR optional \fI\-\-disable\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "autostart optional --disable domain-id"
Configure a domain to be automatically started at boot.
.Sp
The option \fI\-\-disable\fR disable autostarting.
.IP "\fBconsole\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "console domain-id"
Connect the virtual serial console for the guest.
.IP "\fBcreate\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "create FILE"
Create a domain from an \s-1XML\s0 <file> an easy way to create one if you have a pre-existing xen guest created via \fBxm\fR create <\s-1XMLFILE\s0>.
.Sp
\&\fBExample\fR
.Sp
virsh dumpxml <domain\-id> > file.
.IP "\fBdefine\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "define FILE"
Define a domain from an \s-1XML\s0 <file>. The domain definitions is registered
but not started.
.IP "\fBdestroy\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "destroy domain-id"
Immediately terminate the domain domain\-id.  This doesn't give the domain
\&\s-1OS\s0 any chance to react, and it the equivalent of ripping the power
cord out on a physical machine.  In most cases you will want to use
the \fBshutdown\fR command instead.
.IP "\fBdomblkstat\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIblock-device\fR" 4
.IX Item "domblkstat domain block-device"
Get device block stats for a running domain.
.IP "\fBdomifstat\fR \fIdomain\fR \fIinterface-device\fR" 4
.IX Item "domifstat domain interface-device"
Get network interface stats for a running domain.
.IP "\fBdominfo\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "dominfo domain-id"
Returns basic information about the domain.
.IP "\fBdomuuid\fR \fIdomain-name-or-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "domuuid domain-name-or-id"
Convert a domain name or id to domain \s-1UUID\s0
.IP "\fBdomid\fR \fIdomain-name-or-uuid\fR" 4

.IX Item "dump domain-id corefilepath"
Dumps the core of a domain to a file for analysis.
.IP "\fBdumpxml\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "dumpxml domain-id"
Output the domain information as an \s-1XML\s0 dump to stdout, this format can be used by the \fBcreate\fR command.
.IP "\fBmigrate\fR optional \fI\-\-live\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIdesturi\fR \fImigrateuri\fR" 4
.IX Item "migrate optional --live domain-id desturi migrateuri"
Migrate domain to another host.  Add \-\-live for live migration. The \fIdesturi\fR
is the connection \s-1URI\s0 of the destination host, and \fImigrateuri\fR is the
migration \s-1URI\s0, which usually can be omitted.
.IP "\fBreboot\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "reboot domain-id"
Reboot a domain.  This acts just as if the domain had the \fBreboot\fR
command run from the console.  The command returns as soon as it has
executed the reboot action, which may be significantly before the
domain actually reboots.
.Sp
For xen vm the behavior of what happens to a domain when it reboots is set by the
\&\fIon_reboot\fR parameter of the xmdomain.cfg file when the domain was
created.
.IP "\fBrestore\fR \fIstate-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "restore state-file"
Restores a domain from an \fBvirsh save\fR state file.  See \fIsave\fR for more info.
.IP "\fBsave\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIstate-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "save domain-id state-file"
Saves a running domain to a state file so that it can be restored
later.  Once saved, the domain will no longer be running on the
system, thus the memory allocated for the domain will be free for
other domains to use.  \fBvirsh restore\fR restores from this state file.
.Sp
This is roughly equivalent to doing a hibernate on a running computer,
with all the same limitations.  Open network connections may be
severed upon restore, as \s-1TCP\s0 timeouts may have expired.
.IP "\fBschedinfo\fR optional \fI\-\-weight\fR \fBnumber\fR optional \fI\-\-cap\fR \fBnumber\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "schedinfo optional --weight number optional --cap number domain-id"
Allows to show (and set) the domain scheduler parameters. This is currently
only defined for \s-1XEN_CREDIT\s0 scheduler, and the optional weight and cap
arguments allows to set the associated parameters in that scheduler if
provided.
.IP "\fBsetmem\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fBkilobytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "setmem domain-id kilobytes"
Change the current memory allocation in the guest domain. This should take
effect immediately. The memory limit is specified in
kilobytes.
.Sp
For Xen, you can only adjust the memory of a running domain if the
domain is paravirtualized or running the \s-1PV\s0 balloon driver.
.IP "\fBsetmaxmem\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fBkilobytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "setmaxmem domain-id kilobytes"
Change the maximum memory allocation limit in the guest domain. This should
not change the current memory use. The memory limit is specified in
kilobytes.
.IP "\fBsetvcpus\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIcount\fR" 4
.IX Item "setvcpus domain-id count"
Change the number of virtual CPUs active in the guest domain. Note that
\&\fIcount\fR may be limited by host, hypervisor or limit coming from the
original description of domain.
.Sp
For Xen, you can only adjust the virtual CPUs of a running domain if
the domain is paravirtualized.
.IP "\fBshutdown\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "shutdown domain-id"
Gracefully shuts down a domain.  This coordinates with the domain \s-1OS\s0
to perform graceful shutdown, so there is no guarantee that it will
succeed, and may take a variable length of time depending on what
services must be shutdown in the domain.
.Sp
For a xen guest vm the behavior of what happens to a domain when it reboots is set by the
\&\fIon_shutdown\fR parameter of the xmdomain.cfg file when the domain was
created.
.IP "\fBstart\fR \fIdomain-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "start domain-name"
Start a (previously defined) inactive domain.
.IP "\fBsuspend\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "suspend domain-id"
Suspend a running domain. It is kept in memory but won't be scheduled
anymore.
.IP "\fBresume\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "resume domain-id"
Moves a domain out of the suspended state.  This will allow a previously
suspended domain to now be eligible for scheduling by the underlying
hypervisor.
.IP "\fBttyconsole\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "ttyconsole domain-id"
Output the device used for the \s-1TTY\s0 console of the domain. If the information
is not available the processes will provide an exit code of 1.
.IP "\fBundefine\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "undefine domain-id"
Undefine the configuration for an inactive domain. Since it's not running
the domain name or UUId must be used as the \fIdomain-id\fR.
.IP "\fBvcpuinfo\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "vcpuinfo domain-id"
Returns basic information about the domain virtual CPUs, like the number of
vCPUs, the running time, the affinity to physical processors.
.IP "\fBvcpupin\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIvcpu\fR \fIcpulist\fR" 4
.IX Item "vcpupin domain-id vcpu cpulist"
Pin domain VCPUs to host physical CPUs. The \fIvcpu\fR number must be provided
and \fIcpulist\fR is a comma separated list of physical \s-1CPU\s0 numbers.
.IP "\fBvncdisplay\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "vncdisplay domain-id"
Output the \s-1IP\s0 address and port number for the \s-1VNC\s0 display. If the information
is not available the processes will provide an exit code of 1.

define virtual networks which can then be used by domains and linked to
actual network devices. For more detailed information about this feature
see the documentation at <http://libvirt.org/format.html#Net1> . A lot
of the command for virtual networks are similar to the one used for domains,
but the way to name a virtual network is either by its name or \s-1UUID\s0.
.IP "\fBnet-autostart\fR \fInetwork\fR optional \fI\-\-disable\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-autostart network optional --disable"
Configure a virtual network to be automatically started at boot.
The \fI\-\-disable\fR option disable autostarting.
.IP "\fBnet-create\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-create file"
Create a virtual network from an \s-1XML\s0 \fIfile\fR, see the documentation to get
a description of the \s-1XML\s0 network format used by libvirt.
.IP "\fBnet-define\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-define file"
Define a virtual network from an \s-1XML\s0 \fIfile\fR, the network is just defined but
not instantiated.
.IP "\fBnet-destroy\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-destroy network"
Destroy a given virtual network specified by its name or \s-1UUID\s0. This takes
effect immediately.
.IP "\fBnet-dumpxml\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-dumpxml network"
Output the virtual network information as an \s-1XML\s0 dump to stdout.
.IP "\fBnet-list\fR optional \fI\-\-inactive\fR or \fI\-\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-list optional --inactive or --all"
Returns the list of active networks, if \fI\-\-all\fR is specified this will also
include defined but inactive networks, if \fI\-\-inactive\fR is specified only the
inactive ones will be listed.
.IP "\fBnet-name\fR \fInetwork-UUID\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-name network-UUID"
Convert a network \s-1UUID\s0 to network name.
.IP "\fBnet-start\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-start network"
Start a (previously defined) inactive network.
.IP "\fBnet-undefine\fR \fInetwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-undefine network"
Undefine the configuration for an inactive network.
.IP "\fBnet-uuid\fR \fInetwork-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "net-uuid network-name"
Convert a network name to network \s-1UUID\s0.
