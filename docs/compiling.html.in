    <h2><a id="compiling">Compiling a release tarball</a></h2>

    <p>
      libvirt uses the standard configure/make/install steps and mandates
      that the build directory is different that the source directory:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ xz -c libvirt-x.x.x.tar.xz | tar xvf -
$ cd libvirt-x.x.x
$ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
$ ../configure</pre>

    <p>
      The <i>configure</i> script can be given options to change its default
      behaviour.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get the complete list of the options it can take, pass it the
      <i>--help</i> option like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ ../configure <i>--help</i></pre>

    <p>
      When you have determined which options you want to use (if any),
      continue the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note the use of <b>sudo</b> with the <i>make install</i> command
      below.  Using sudo is only required when installing to a location your
      user does not have write access to.  Installing to a system location
      is a good example of this.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are installing to a location that your user <i>does</i> have write
      access to, then you can instead run the <i>make install</i> command
      without putting <b>sudo</b> before it.
    </p>

    <pre>
$ ../configure <i>[possible options]</i>
$ make
$ <b>sudo</b> <i>make install</i></pre>

    <p>
      At this point you <b>may</b> have to run ldconfig or a similar utility
      to update your list of installed shared libs.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="building">Building from a GIT checkout</a></h2>

    <p>
      The libvirt build process uses GNU autotools, so after obtaining a
      checkout it is necessary to generate the configure script and Makefile.in
      templates using the <code>autogen.sh</code> command. By default when
      the <code>configure</code> script is run from within a GIT checkout, it
      will turn on -Werror for builds. This can be disabled with
      --disable-werror, but this is not recommended.
    </p>

    <p>To build &amp; install libvirt to your home
      directory the following commands can be run:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$HOME/usr
$ make
$ <b>sudo</b> make install</pre>

    <p>
      Be aware though, that binaries built with a custom prefix will not
      interoperate with OS vendor provided binaries, since the UNIX socket
      paths will all be different. To produce a build that is compatible
      with normal OS vendor prefixes, use
    </p>

    <pre>
$ ./autogen.sh --system
$ make
    </pre>

    <p>
      When doing this for day-to-day development purposes, it is recommended
      not to install over the OS vendor provided binaries. Instead simply
      run libvirt directly from the source tree. For example to run
      a privileged libvirtd instance
    </p>

    <pre>
$ su -
# service libvirtd stop  (or systemctl stop libvirtd.service)
# /home/to/your/checkout/src/libvirtd
    </pre>

    <p>
      It is also possible to run virsh directly from the source tree
      using the ./run script (which sets some environment variables):
    </p>

    <pre>
$ ./run ./tools/virsh ....
    </pre>
  </body>
