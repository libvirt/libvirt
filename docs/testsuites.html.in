    <h1>Test suites</h1>
    <p>There is a few test suites available to developers for testing
    a given version of libvirt:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the internal test suite: present in the source code, it is run
          by developers before submitting patches upstream, it is also
          suggested to have it run and pass as part of the packaging
          process for distributions. It is run by launching:
          <pre>make check</pre>
          in a source tree after compilation has finished. It doesn't
          really make functional testing but checks that large portions
          of the code not interacting directly with virtualization
          functions properly.
      </li>
      <li>the <a href="testtck.html">TCK test suite</a> is a functional
          test suite implemented using the
          <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sys-Virt/">Perl bindings</a>
          of libvirt. It is available separately as a
          <a href="ftp://libvirt.org/libvirt/tck/">download</a>, as a
          <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libvirt-tck">package</a>
          in Fedora distributions, but best is probably to get
          the <a href="http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-tck.git">version
          from GIT</a>.
      <li>the <a href="testapi.html">libvirt-test-API</a> is also a functional
          test suite, but implemented using the
          <a href="python.html">Python bindings</a>
          of libvirt. It is available separately as a
          <a href="ftp://libvirt.org/libvirt/libvirt-test-API/">download</a>,
          or directly get
          the <a href="http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-test-API.git">version
          from GIT</a>.
    </ul>
