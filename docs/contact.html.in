    <h2><a id="security">Security Issues</a></h2>

    <p>
      If you think that an issue with libvirt may have security
      implications, <strong>please do not</strong> publicly
      report it in the bug tracker, mailing lists, or irc. Libvirt
      has <a href="securityprocess.html">a dedicated process for handling (potential) security issues</a>
      that should be used instead. So if your issue has security
      implications, ignore the rest of this page and follow the
      <a href="securityprocess.html">security process</a> instead.
    </p>
