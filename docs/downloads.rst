Primary download site
---------------------

Most modules have releases made available for download on the project site via
HTTPS. Some modules are instead made available at alternative locations, for
example, the Perl binding is made available only on CPAN.

-  `libvirt.org HTTPS server <https://download.libvirt.org/>`__

Primary release schedule
------------------------

The core libvirt module follows a time based plan, with releases made once a
month on the 1st of each month give or take a few days. The only exception is at
the start of the year where there are two 6 weeks gaps (first release in the
middle of Jan, then skip the Feb release), giving a total of 11 releases a year.
The Python, Perl and Go modules will aim to release at the same time as the core
libvirt module. Other modules have independent ad-hoc releases with no fixed
time schedule.

Release numbering
-----------------

Since libvirt 2.0.0, a time based version numbering rule is applied to the core
library releases. As such, the changes in version number have do not have any
implications with respect to the scope of features or bugfixes included, the
stability of the code, or the API / ABI compatibility (libvirt API / ABI is
guaranteed stable forever). The rules applied for changing the libvirt version
number are:

``major``
   incremented by 1 for the first release of the year (the Jan 15th release)
``minor``
   reset to 0 with every major increment, otherwise incremented by 1 for each
   monthly release from git master
``micro``
   always 0 for releases from git master, incremented by 1 for each stable
   maintenance release

Prior to 2.0.0, the major/minor numbers were incremented fairly arbitrarily, and
maintenance releases appended a fourth digit. The language bindings will aim to
use the same version number as the most recent core library API they support.
The other modules have their own distinct release numbering sequence, though
they generally aim to follow the above rules for incrementing major/minor/micro
digits.

Maintenance releases
--------------------

In the git repository are several stable maintenance branches for the core
library, matching the pattern ``vmajor.minor-maint``; these branches are forked
off the corresponding ``vmajor.minor.0`` formal release, and may have further
releases of the form ``vmajor.minor.micro``. These maintenance branches should
only contain bug fixes, and no new features, backported from the master branch,
and are supported as long as at least one downstream distribution expresses
interest in a given branch. These maintenance branches are considered during CVE
analysis. In contrast to the primary releases which are made once a month, there
is no formal schedule for the maintenance releases, which are made whenever
there is a need to make available key bugfixes to downstream consumers. The
language bindings and other modules generally do not provide stable branch
releases.

For more details about contents of maintenance releases, see `the wiki
page <https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Maintenance_Releases>`__.

GIT source repository
---------------------

All modules maintained by the libvirt project have their primary source
available in the `libvirt group on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/>`__.
Each module can be cloned anonymously using:

::

   git clone https://gitlab.com/libvirt/[module name].git

In addition to this primary repository, there are mirrored read-only git
repositories on GitHub:

::

   https://github.com/libvirt/

And there are also read-only mirrors on libvirt.org:

::

   git clone https://libvirt.org/git/[module name].git

Note that for most repositories, development happens via merge requests
on GitLab. However, for the main `libvirt.git` repository all patch review and
discussion only occurs on the `devel <contact.html>`__ mailing list.

The GitHub repository is read-only and pull requests and issues there are ignored.

Signing keys
------------

Source RPM packages and tarballs for libvirt and libvirt-python published on
this project site are signed with a GPG signature. You should always verify the
package signature before using the source to compile binary packages. The
following key is currently used to generate the GPG signatures:

::

   pub  4096R/10084C9C 2020-07-20 Jiří Denemark <jdenemar@redhat.com>
   Fingerprint=453B 6531 0595 5628 5547  1199 CA68 BE80 1008 4C9C

It can be downloaded from `this
site <https://download.libvirt.org/gpg_key.asc>`__ or from public GPG key
servers.

Releases prior to libvirt-6.6 were signed with the following GPG key:

::

   pub   dsa1024 2000-05-31 [SC]
   C744 15BA 7C9C 7F78 F02E  1DC3 4606 B8A5 DE95 BC1F
   uid           [ unknown] Daniel Veillard (Red Hat work email) <veillard@redhat.com>
