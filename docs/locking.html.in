    <h1>Virtual machine disk locking</h1>

    <ul id="toc"></ul>

    <p>
      This page describes how to ensure a single disk cannot be
      used by more than one running VM at a time, across any
      host in a network. This is critical to avoid data corruption
      of guest files systems that are not cluster aware.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="plugins">Lock manager plugins</a></h2>

    <p>
      libvirt includes a pluggable framework for lock managers,
      which hypervisor drivers can use to ensure safety for
      guest domain disks, and potentially other resources.
      At this time there are only two plugin implementations,
      a "no op" implementation which does absolutely nothing,
      and a <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/sanlock/">sanlock</a> implementation which uses
      the Disk Paxos algorithm to ensure safety.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sanlock">Sanlock daemon setup</a></h2>

    <p>
      On many operating systems, the <strong>sanlock</strong> plugin
      is distributed in a sub-package which needs to be installed
      separately from the main libvirt RPM. On a Fedora/RHEL host
      this can be done with the <code>yum</code> command
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ su - root
      # yum install libvirt-lock-sanlock
    </pre>

    <p>
      The next step is to start the sanlock daemon. For maximum
      safety sanlock prefers to have a connection to a watchdog
      daemon. This will cause the entire host to be rebooted in
      the event that sanlock crashes / terminates abnormally.
      To start the watchdog daemon on a Fedora/RHEL host
      the following commands can be run:
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ su - root
      # chkconfig wdmd on
      # service wdmd start
    </pre>

    <p>
      Once the watchdog is running, sanlock can be started
      as follows
    </p>

    <pre>
      # chkconfig sanlock on
      # service sanlock start
    </pre>

    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> if you wish to avoid the use of the
      watchdog, add the following line to <code>/etc/sysconfig/sanlock</code>
      before starting it
    </p>

    <pre>
      SANLOCKOPTS="-w 0"
    </pre>

    <p>
      The sanlock daemon must be started on every single host
      that will be running virtual machines. So repeat these
      steps as necessary.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sanlockplugin">libvirt sanlock plugin configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
      Once the sanlock daemon is running, the next step is to
      configure the libvirt sanlock plugin. There is a separate
      configuration file for each libvirt driver that is using
      sanlock. For QEMU, we will edit <code>/etc/libvirt/qemu-sanlock.conf</code>
      There is one mandatory parameter that needs to be set,
      the <code>host_id</code>. This is a integer between
      1 and 2000, which must be set to a <strong>unique</strong>
      value on each host running virtual machines.
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ su - root
      # augtool -s set /files/etc/libvirt/qemu-sanlock.conf/host_id 1
    </pre>

    <p>
      Repeat this on every host, changing <strong>1</strong> to a
      unique value for the host.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sanlockstorage">libvirt sanlock storage configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
      The sanlock plugin needs to create leases in a directory
      that is on a filesystem shared between all hosts running
      virtual machines. Obvious choices for this include NFS
      or GFS2. The libvirt sanlock plugin expects its lease
      directory be at <code>/var/lib/libvirt/sanlock</code>
      so update the host's <code>/etc/fstab</code> to mount
      a suitable shared/cluster filesystem at that location
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ su - root
      # echo "some.nfs.server:/export/sanlock /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock nfs hard,nointr 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
      # mount /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock
    </pre>

    <p>
      In terms of storage requirements, if the filesystem
      uses 512 byte sectors, you need to allow for <code>1MB</code>
      of storage for each guest disk. So if you have a network
      with 20 virtualization hosts, each running 50 virtual
      machines and an average of 2 disks per guest, you will
      need <code>20*50*2 == 2000 MB</code> of storage for
      sanlock.
    </p>


    <p>
      On one of the hosts on the network is it wise to setup
      a cron job which runs the <code>virt-sanlock-cleanup</code>
      script periodically. This scripts deletes any lease
      files which are not currently in use by running virtual
      machines, freeing up disk space on the shared filesystem.
      Unless VM disks are very frequently created + deleted
      it should be sufficient to run the cleanup once a week.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="qemuconfig">QEMU/KVM driver configuration</a></h2>

    <p>
      The QEMU/KVM driver is fully integrated with the lock
      manager framework as of release <span>0.9.3</span>.
      The out of the box configuration, however, currently
      uses the <strong>nop</strong> lock manager plugin.
      To get protection for disks, it is thus necessary
      to reconfigure QEMU to activate the <strong>sanlock</strong>
      driver. This is achieved by editing the QEMU driver
      configuration file (<code>/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf</code>)
      and changing the <code>lock_manager</code> configuration
      tunable.
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ su - root
      # augtool -s  set /files/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf/lock_manager sanlock
      # service libvirtd restart
    </pre>

    <p>
      If all went well, libvirtd will have talked to sanlock
      and created the basic lockspace. This can be checked
      by looking for existance of the following file
    </p>

    <pre>
      # ls /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock/
      __LIBVIRT__DISKS__
    </pre>

    <p>
      Every time you start a guest, additional lease files will appear
      in this directory, one for each virtual disk. The lease
      files are named based on the MD5 checksum of the fully qualified
      path of the virtual disk backing file. So if the guest is given
      a disk backed by <code>/var/lib/libvirt/images/demo.img</code>
      expect to see a lease <code>/var/lib/libvirt/sanlock/bfa0240911bc17753e0b473688822159</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be obvious that for locking to work correctly, every
      host running virtual machines should have storage configured
      in the same way. The easiest way to do this is to use the libvirt
      storage pool capability to configure any NFS volumes, iSCSI targets,
      or SCSI HBAs used for guest storage. Simply replicate the same
      storage pool XML across every host. It is important that any
      storage pools exposing block devices are configured to create
      volume paths under <code>/dev/disks/by-path</code> to ensure
      stable paths across hosts. An example iSCSI configuration
      which ensures this is:
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;pool type='iscsi'&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;myiscsipool&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;source&gt;
    &lt;host name='192.168.254.8'/&gt;
    &lt;device path='your-iscsi-target-iqn'/&gt;
  &lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;target&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;/dev/disk/by-path&lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/pool&gt;
    </pre>
