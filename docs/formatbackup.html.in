    <h2><a id="BackupAttributes">Backup XML</a></h2>

    <p>
      Creating a backup, whether full or incremental, is done
      via <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code>, which takes an XML
      description of the actions to perform, as well as an optional
      second XML document <a href="formatcheckpoint.html">describing a
      checkpoint</a> to create at the same point in time. See
      also <a href="kbase/domainstatecapture.html">a comparison</a> between
      the various state capture APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two general modes for backups: a push mode (where the
      hypervisor writes out the data to the destination file, which
      may be local or remote), and a pull mode (where the hypervisor
      creates an NBD server that a third-party client can then read as
      needed, and which requires the use of temporary storage,
      typically local, until the backup is complete).
    </p>
    <p>
      The instructions for beginning a backup job are provided as
      attributes and elements of the
      top-level <code>domainbackup</code> element. This element
      includes an optional attribute <code>mode</code> which can be
      either "push" or "pull" (default
      push). <code>virDomainBackupGetXMLDesc()</code> can be used to
      see the actual values selected for elements omitted during
      creation (for example, learning which port the NBD server is
      using in the pull model or what file names libvirt generated
      when none were supplied). The following child elements and attributes
      are supported:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>incremental</code></dt>
      <dd>An optional element giving the name of an existing
        checkpoint of the domain, which will be used to make this
        backup an incremental one. In the push model, only changes
        since the named checkpoint are written to the destination. In
        the pull model, the NBD server uses the
        NBD_OPT_SET_META_CONTEXT extension to advertise to the client
        which portions of the export contain changes since the named
        checkpoint. If omitted, a full backup is performed.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>server</code></dt>
      <dd>Present only for a pull mode backup. Contains the same
        attributes as
        the <a href="formatdomain.html#elementsDisks"><code>protocol</code>
        element of a disk</a> attached via NBD in the domain (such as
        transport, socket, name, port, or tls), necessary to set up an
        NBD server that exposes the content of each disk at the time
        the backup is started.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>disks</code></dt>
      <dd>An optional listing of instructions for disks participating
        in the backup (if omitted, all disks participate and libvirt
        attempts to generate filenames by appending the current
        timestamp as a suffix). If the entire element was omitted on
        input, then all disks participate in the backup, otherwise,
        only the disks explicitly listed which do not also
        use <code>backup='no'</code> will participate. On output, this
        is the state of each of the domain's disk in relation to the
        backup operation.
        <dl>
          <dt><code>disk</code></dt>
          <dd>This sub-element describes the backup properties of a
            specific disk, with the following attributes and child
            elements:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>name</code></dt>
              <dd>A mandatory attribute which must match
                the <code>&lt;target dev='name'/&gt;</code>
                of one of
                the <a href="formatdomain.html#elementsDisks">disk
                devices</a> specified for the domain at the time of
                the checkpoint.</dd>
              <dt><code>backup</code></dt>
              <dd>Setting this attribute to <code>yes</code>(default) specifies
                that the disk should take part in the backup and using
                <code>no</code> excludes the disk from the backup.</dd>
              <dt><code>exportname</code></dt>
              <dd>Allows modification of the NBD export name for the given disk.
                By default equal to disk target.
                Valid only for pull mode backups.</dd>
              <dt><code>exportbitmap</code></dt>
              <dd>Allows modification of the name of the bitmap describing dirty
                blocks for an incremental backup exported via NBD export name
                for the given disk.
                Valid only for pull mode backups.</dd>
              <dt><code>type</code></dt>
              <dd>A mandatory attribute to describe the type of the
                disk, except when <code>backup='no'</code> is
                used. Valid values include <code>file</code>, or
                <code>block</code>.
                Similar to a disk declaration for a domain, the choice of type
                controls what additional sub-elements are needed to describe
                the destination.</dd>
              <dt><code>target</code></dt>
              <dd>Valid only for push mode backups, this is the
                primary sub-element that describes the file name of
                the backup destination, similar to
                the <code>source</code> sub-element of a domain
                disk. An optional sub-element <code>driver</code> can
                also be used, with an attribute <code>type</code> to
                specify a destination format different from
                qcow2. See documentation for <code>scratch</code> below for
                additional configuration.</dd>
              <dt><code>scratch</code></dt>
              <dd>Valid only for pull mode backups, this is the
                primary sub-element that describes the file name of
                the local scratch file to be used in facilitating the
                backup, and is similar to the <code>source</code>
                sub-element of a domain disk. Currently only <code>file</code>
                and <code>block</code> scratch storage is supported. The
                <code>file</code> scratch file is created and deleted by
                libvirt in the given location. A <code>block</code> scratch
                device must exist prior to starting the backup and is formatted.
                The block device must have enough space for the corresponding
                disk data including format overhead.

                If <code>VIR_DOMAIN_BACKUP_BEGIN_REUSE_EXTERNAL</code> flag is
                used the file for a scratch of <code>file</code> type must
                exist with the correct format and size to hold the copy and is
                used without modification. The file is not deleted after the
                backup but the contents of the file don't make sense outside
                of the backup. The same applies for the block device which
                must be formatted appropriately.

                Similarly to the domain
                <a href="formatdomain.html#elementsDisks"><code>disk</code></a>
                definition <code>scratch</code> and <code>target</code> can
                contain <code>seclabel</code> and/or <code>encryption</code>
                subelements to configure the corresponding properties.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2><a id="example">Examples</a></h2>

    <p>Use <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code> to perform a full
      backup using push mode. The example lets libvirt pick the
      destination and format for 'vda', fully specifies that we want a
      raw backup of 'vdb', and omits 'vdc' from the operation.
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;domainbackup&gt;
  &lt;disks&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vda' backup='yes'/&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vdb' type='file'&gt;
      &lt;target file='/path/to/vdb.backup'/&gt;
      &lt;driver type='raw'/&gt;
    &lt;/disk&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vdc' backup='no'/&gt;
  &lt;/disks&gt;
&lt;/domainbackup&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>If the previous full backup also passed a parameter describing
      <a href="formatcheckpoint.html">checkpoint XML</a> that resulted
      in a checkpoint named <code>1525889631</code>, we can make
      another call to <code>virDomainBackupBegin()</code> to perform
      an incremental backup of just the data changed since that
      checkpoint, this time using the following XML to start a pull
      model export of the 'vda' and 'vdb' disks, where a third-party
      NBD client connecting to '/path/to/server' completes the backup
      (omitting 'vdc' from the explicit list has the same effect as
      the backup='no' from the previous example):
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;domainbackup mode="pull"&gt;
  &lt;incremental&gt;1525889631&lt;/incremental&gt;
  &lt;server transport="unix" socket="/path/to/server"/&gt;
  &lt;disks&gt;
    &lt;disk name='vda' backup='yes' type='file'&gt;
      &lt;scratch file='/path/to/file1.scratch'/&gt;
    &lt;/disk&gt;
  &lt;/disks&gt;
&lt;/domainbackup&gt;
    </pre>
