    <h1>libvirt TCK  : Technology Compatibility Kit</h1>
    <p>The libvirt TCK provides a framework for performing testing
    of the integration between libvirt drivers, the underlying virt
    hypervisor technology, related operating system services and system
    configuration. The idea (and name) is motivated by the Java TCK.</p>
    <p>In particular the libvirt TCK is intended to address the following
    scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate that a new libvirt driver is in compliance
          with the (possibly undocumented!) driver API semantics</li>
      <li>Validate that an update to an existing driver does not
         change the API semantics in a non-compliant manner</li>
      <li>Validate that a new hypervisor release is still providing
         compatibility with the corresponding libvirt driver usage</li>
      <li>Validate that an OS distro deployment consisting of a
         hypervisor and libvirt release is configured correctly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus the libvirt TCK will allow developers, administrators and users
    to determine the level of compatibility of their platform, and
    evaluate whether it will meet their needs, and get awareness of any
    regressions that may have occurred since a previous test run.</p>
    <p>For more details you can look at:</p>

    <p> Libvirt-TCK is maintained using
        <a href="https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-tck.git">a GIT
        repository</a>, and comment, patches and reviews are carried
        on the <a href="contact.html">libvir-list</a> development list.</p>
