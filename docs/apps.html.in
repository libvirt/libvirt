      <dt>virsh</dt>
      <dd>
        An interactive shell, and batch scriptable tool for performing
        management tasks on all libvirt managed domains, networks and
        storage. This is part of the libvirt core distribution.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-install</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Provides a way to provision new virtual machines from a
        OS distribution install tree. It supports provisioning from
        local CD images, and the network over NFS, HTTP and FTP.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-clone</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Allows the disk image(s) and configuration for an existing
        virtual machine to be cloned to form a new virtual machine.
        It automates copying of data across to new disk images, and
        updates the UUID, Mac address and name in the configuration
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-image</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Provides a way to deploy virtual appliances. It defines a
        simplified portable XML format describing the pre-requisites
        of a virtual machine. At time of deployment this is translated
        into the domain XML format for execution under any libvirt
        hypervisor meeting the pre-requisites.

      <dd>
        Examine the utilization of each filesystem in a virtual machine
        from the comfort of the host machine. This tool peeks into the
        guest disks and determines how much space is used. It can cope
        with common Linux filesystems and LVM volumes.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-top/">virt-top</a></dt>

      <dd>
        A general purpose desktop management tool, able to manage
        virtual machines across both local and remotely accessed
        hypervisors. It is targeted at home and small office usage
        upto managing 10-20 hosts and their VMs.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-viewer</a></dt>
      <dd>
        A lightweight tool for accessing the graphical console
        associated with a virtual machine. It can securely connect
        to remote consoles supporting the VNC protocol. Also provides
        an optional mozilla browser plugin.

      <dd>
        oVirt provides the ability to manage large numbers of virtual
        machines across an entire data center of hosts. It integrates
        with FreeIPA for Kerberos authentication, and in the future,
        certificate management.

        AbiCloud is an open source cloud platform manager which allows to
        easily deploy a private cloud in your datacenter. One of the key
        differences of AbiCloud is the web rich interface for managing the
        infrastructure. You can deploy a new service just dragging and
        dropping a VM.

      <dd>
        A tool for converting a physical machine into a virtual machine. It
        is a LiveCD which is booted on the machine to be converted. It collects
        a little information from the user and then copies the disks over to
        a remote machine and defines the XML for a domain to run the guest.
