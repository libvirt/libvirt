    <h1>Applications using <strong>libvirt</strong></h1>

    <p>
      This page provides an illustration of the wide variety of
      applications using the libvirt management API.

    <h2><a name="add">Add an application</a></h2>

    <p>
      To add an application not listed on this page, send a message
      to the <a href="contact.html">mailing list</a>, requesting it
      be added here, or simply send a patch against the documentation
      in the libvirt.git docs subdirectory.
      If your application uses libvirt as its API,
      the following graphic is available for your website to advertise
      support for libvirt:

        Archipel is a libvirt-based solution to manage and supervise virtual
        machines.  It uses XMPP for all communication. There is no web
        service or custom protocol.  You just need at least one XMPP server,
        like eJabberd, to start playing with it.  This allows Archipel to
        work completely real time.  You never have to refresh the user
        interface, you'll be notified as soon as something happens. You can
        even use your favorite chat clients to command your infrastructure.

        Isn't it great to be able to open a chat conversation with your
