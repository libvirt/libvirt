=======================
Cloud Hypervisor driver
=======================

.. contents::

Cloud Hypervisor is an open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that
runs on top of KVM. The project focuses on exclusively running modern,
cloud workloads, on top of a limited set of hardware architectures and
platforms. Cloud workloads refers to those that are usually run by
customers inside a cloud provider. For our purposes this means modern
operating systems with most I/O handled by paravirtualised devices
(i.e. virtio), no requirement for legacy devices, and 64-bit CPUs.

The libvirt Cloud Hypervisor (CH) driver is intended to be run as a
session driver without privileges. The cloud-hypervisor binary itself
should be ``setcap cap_net_admin+ep`` (in order to create tap
interfaces). Though, system-wide connection URI is also supported.

Expected connection URI would be

::

  ch:///session         (local access to per-user instance)
  ch:///system          (local access to system instance)

But all other transport modes are supported too
(see `documentation <uri.html#remote-uris>`__).


Example guest domain XML configurations
---------------------------------------

The Cloud Hypervisor driver in libvirt is in its early stage under active
development only supporting a limited number of Cloud Hypervisor features.

Firmware is from
`hypervisor-fw <https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/rust-hypervisor-firmware/releases>`__

**Note: Only virtio devices are supported**
