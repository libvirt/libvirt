          hyperv: Support Hyper-V 2012 and newer
        </summary>
        <description>
          Starting with Hyper-V 2012 the API has changed causing the existing
          driver to be unable to send and process requests properly. This has
          been resolved by adding abstractions to handle the differences and
          ease handling such breaks if they happen in the future.

          libxl: Add support for nested HVM domains
        </summary>
        <description>
          Xen has supported nested HVM domains since version 4.4. The
          libvirt libxl driver now supports nested HVM domains by
          specifying the host-passthrough CPU mode when defining a
          domain.

        <description>
          NVDIMM is new type of memory introduced into QEMU 2.6. The idea is
          that we have a non-volatile memory module that keeps the data
          persistent across domain reboots and offers much faster data
          accesses.  However, due to a bug in QEMU, this feature is not enabled
          for QEMUs older than 2.9.0.

          by default instead of the Intel-specific device (ioh3420), provided
          the QEMU binary supports it.

          qemu: Add support for checking guest CPU ABI compatibility
        </summary>
        <description>
          When migrating a domain to a different host, restoring a domain from
          a file or reverting a snapshot libvirt will make sure the guest CPU
          QEMU presents to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on
          the source host (or before the domain's state was saved). This
          enhanced check may also be requested when starting a new domain to
          ensure the virtual CPU exactly matches the one specified in the XML.

          VIR_MIGRATE_TLS or virsh migrate '--tls' option. Requires using at

          Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so
          provide an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by
          introducing a new host device type in the XML.

          Add support for block device threshold event
        </summary>
        <description>
          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the
          disk in certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage
          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

           bhyve: Add support for UEFI boot ROM, VNC, and USB tablet
        </summary>
        <description>
          The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM,
          so non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without
          using an external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also
          supported now, allowing to connect to guests via VNC and use
          an USB tablet as an input device. Please refer to
          the driver page for domain XML examples.

          qemu: Detect host CPU model by asking QEMU on x86_64
        </summary>
        <description>
          Previously, libvirt detected the host CPU model using CPUID
          instruction, which caused libvirt to detect a lot of CPU features
          that are not supported by QEMU/KVM. Asking QEMU makes sure we
          don't start it with unsupported features.

          qemu's implementation of the hyperv panic notifier now reports
          information about the crash from the guest os. Starting with this

          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor
        </summary>
        <description>
          When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor
          socket which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30
          second timeout after which the qemu process was killed. This
          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

          fabric name for an fcp host. The requirement for the existence of
          a fabric name has been removed by making it optional.

          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        </summary>
        <description>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

          vbox: remove support for VirtualBox 3.x and older
        </summary>
        <description>
          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by
          upstream for a long time and the API of 4.0 and newer has
          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from
          the driver and simplifies the logic to ease implementation of new
          features going forward.

          Improve the algorithm searching for the parent scsi_host device
          for vHBA/NPIV scsi_host creation. Rather than supplying the
          "parent" by name, it's now possible to define the parent by

          qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot
        </summary>
        <description>
          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.

          lxc: fix accidental killing of containers during libvirtd restart

        <description>
          The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the
          container scope. As a result, if systemd reloads its config
          after a container is started, when libvirtd is later restarted
          it will accidentally kill the containers.

          separate path which is also correctly labeled.

          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed.
