        <description>
          SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is a feature available on AMD
          CPUs that encrypts the guest memory and makes it inaccessible even
          to the host OS.

          Disallow using a qcow encrypted volume for the guest and
          disallow creation of the qcow or default encrypted volume
          from the storage driver. Support for qcow encrypted volumes
          has been phasing out since QEMU 2.3 and by QEMU 2.9 creation
          of a qcow encrypted volume via qemu-img required usage of
          secret objects, but that support was never added to libvirt.

          qemu: Allow concurrent access to monitor and guest agent
        </summary>
        <description>
          Historically libvirt prevented concurrent accesses to
          the qemu monitor and the guest agent. Therefore two
          independent calls (one querying the monitor and the
          other querying guest agent) would serialize which hurts
          performance. The code was reworked to allow two
          independent calls run at the same time.

          For HPT pSeries guests, the size of the host pages used to back guest
          memory and the usable guest page sizes are connected; the new setting
          can be used to request that a certain page size is available in the
          guest.

          Instead of having QEMU open the socket and then connecting to it,
          which is inherently racy, starting with QEMU 2.12 we can open the
          socket ourselves and pass it to QEMU, avoiding race conditions.

        <description>
          Initialization of the driver worker pool needs to come before libvirtd
          trying to reconnect to all machines, since one of the QEMU processes
          migh have already emitted events which need to be handled prior to
          us getting to the worker pool initialization.

        <description>
          Recent versions of QEMU activate block devices before the guest CPU
          has been started, which makes it impossible to roll back a failed
          migration. Use the <code>late-block-activate</code> migration
          capability if supported to avoid the issue.

          The CPU model presented to Xen HVM domains is equivalent to libvirt's

          Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight
        </summary>
        <description>
          The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain
          scheduler weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided
          <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;cputune&gt;</code>. The
          driver now honors <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code>, and defers setting
          a default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any
          domains started after this improvement will have one fourth the
          shares of previously started domains. If all domains must have
          equal CPU shares, administrators must manually set the weight of
          previously started domains to 256, or restart them.

              type='ide'&gt;</code> which is used by the VBOX driver to set the
          IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
          'ich6'.  Finally, with this change <code>dumpxml</code> generates
          <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code> elements that correspond to current

              type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'&gt;</code> element. If there are
          both SCSI and SAS controllers present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML
          can associate the disk device using the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
          element with the <code>controller</code> attribute, and optionally,
          set the port via <code>unit</code> attribute.

          of those disks in qemu so that the image locking is not applied in
          that case. Additionally libvirt now checks that shareable disks have
          supported format (raw) to avoid metadata corruption.

          Fix swapped interface statistics and QoS
        </summary>
        <description>
          Due to internal implementation, reported statistics for
          some types of interfaces were swapped (RX appeared in
          TX and vice versa). Similarly, QoS was set in reversed
          way.

          Resizing of a local LUKS encrypted volume will now use qemu-img
          to resize the volume. This will require configuring a secret for

          libvirt, which means they could be assigned to more than one device
          resulting in the guest failing to start.

          qemu: Ensure TLS clients always verify the server certificate

        <description>
          While it's reasonable to turn off client certificate validation,
          as setting it up can be non-trivial, clients should always verify
          the server certificate to avoid MITM attacks. However, libvirt was
          using the same knob to control both checks, leading to
          CVE-2017-1000256 / LSN-2017-0002.

          This could be seen with newer kernels that have bug regarding

          qemu: add mediated devices framework support
        </summary>
        <description>
          Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so
          provide an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by
          introducing a new host device type in the XML.

        </summary>
        <description>
          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the
          disk in certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage
          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

        </summary>
        <description>
          The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM,
          so non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without
          using an external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also
          supported now, allowing to connect to guests via VNC and use
          an USB tablet as an input device. Please refer to
          the driver page for domain XML examples.

          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor
        </summary>
        <description>
          When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor
          socket which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30
          second timeout after which the qemu process was killed. This
          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        </summary>
        <description>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

          qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis
        </summary>
        <description>
          Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
          hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels
          on it. With this release, however, each domain is put into a
          separate path which is also correctly labeled.

          libxl: reverse defaults on HVM net device attach

        <description>
          Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is
          specified. Emulated hotplug isn't yet supported and hence we should
          default to the general working scenario.

        <description>
          By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit &lt;pae/&gt;
          setting in the domain &lt;features&gt; configuration, an x86_64 HVM
          domain would be get an i686 environment. pae should always be enabled
          for x86_64 HVM domains.

          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed.
