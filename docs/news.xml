<!-- libvirt release notes

     This file will be processed to produce both HTML and plain text versions
     of the release notes.

     Keep the style consistent with existing entries as much as possible.

     Each change should be documented by a short, one-sentence summary, which
     should fit in a single line and should not contain any formatting tags.

     You can optionally add a description if you feel like the summary alone is
     not enough to document the change accurately. The description may contain
     a <code> tag for switching to non-proportional font. No other tags are
     allowed.

     Lines should be kept under 80 columns, and should not exceed 100 columns.

     This file is validated against docs/news.rng schema.

          qemu: NVDIMM support for pSeries guests
        </summary>
        <description>
          QEMU 5.0 implements NVDIMM memory support for pSeries guests. This
          is done by adding an 'uuid' element in the memory XML, which can
          either be provided in the XML or, if ommited, generated
          automatically.

          With switching of our internal code to GLib, parsing of client

          (<code>;</code>). Use number sign (<code>#</code>) instead.

          qemu: Open backing chain late for shallow block copy reusing external images
        </summary>
        <description>
          With introduction of -blockdev for QEMU storage configuration
          in libvirt-5.10 we've started opening the backing chain of the
          destination/mirror of a virDomainBlockcopy started with
          VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_REUSE_EXT | VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_COPY_SHALLOW flags
          when starting the job rather than when virDomainBlockJobAbort with
          VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_JOB_ABORT_PIVOT is issued. For users depending on
          this undocumented quirky pre-blockdev behaviour this caused a
          regression as the backing chain could not be modified while the copy
          of the top image was progressing due to QEMU image locking. Note that
          this fix also requires qemu-5.0 while -blockdev is used starting from
          QEMU-4.2.

          support for virtio+hostdev NIC &lt;teaming&gt;
        </summary>
        <description>
          QEMU 4.2.0 and later, combined with a sufficiently recent
          guest virtio-net driver (e.g. the driver included in Linux
          kernel 4.18 and later), supports setting up a simple network
          bond device comprised of one virtio emulated NIC and one
          hostdev NIC (which must be an SRIOV VF). (in QEMU, this is
          known as the "virtio failover" feature). The allure of this
          setup is that the bond will always favor the hostdev device,
          providing better performance, until the guest is migrated -
          at that time QEMU will automatically unplug the hostdev NIC
          and the bond will send all traffic via the virtio NIC until
          migration is completed, then QEMU on the destination side
          will hotplug a new hostdev NIC and the bond will switch back
          to using the hostdev for network traffic. The result is that
          guests desiring the extra performance of a hostdev NIC are
          now migratable without network downtime (performance is just
          degraded during migration) and without requiring a
          complicated bonding configuration in the guest OS network
          config and complicated unplug/replug logic in the management
          application on the host - it can instead all be accomplished
          in libvirt with the interface &lt;teaming&gt; subelement
          "type" and "persistent" attributes.

          support BR_ISOLATED flag for guest interfaces attached to a Linux host bridge
        </summary>
        <description>
          Since Linux kernel 4.18, the Linux host bridge has had a
          flag BR_ISOLATED that can be applied to individual
          ports. When this flag is set for a port, traffic is blocked
          between that port and any other port that also has the
          BR_ISOLATED flag set. libvirt domain interface config now
          supports setting this flag via the &lt;port
          isolated='yes'/&gt; setting. It can also be set for all
          connections to a particular libvirt network by setting the
          same option in the network config - since the port for the
          host itself does not have BR_ISOLATED set, the guests can
          communicate with the host and the outside world, but guests
          on that network can't communicate with each other. This
          feature works for QEMU and LXC guests with interfaces
          attached to a Linux host bridge.

        <description>
          Historically libvirt has embedded gnulib to provide fixes for
          various platform portability problems. This usage has now been
          eliminated and alternative approaches for platform portability
          problems adopted where required. This has been validated on the
          set of platforms covered by automated CI build testing. Other
          modern Linux distros using glibc are expected to work. Linux
          distros using non-glibc packages, and other non-Linux platforms
          may encounter regressions when building this release. Please
          report any build problems encountered back to the project
          maintainers for evaluation.

          new PCI hostdev address type: unassigned

        <description>
          A new PCI hostdev address type 'unassigned' is introduced. An
          unassigned PCI hostdev behaves like any regular PCI hostdev
          inside Libvirt, but it is not usable by the guest. This gives
          the user a new option to manage the binding of PCI devices
          via Libvirt, declaring PCI hostdevs in the domain XML
          but allowing just a subset of them to be assigned to the
          guest.

          qemu: Allow accessing NVMe disks directly
        </summary>
        <description>
          Before this release there were two ways to configure a NVMe disk for
          a domain. The first was using &lt;disk/&gt; with the &lt;source/&gt;
          pointing to the <code>/dev/nvmeXXXX</code>. The other was using PCI
          assignment via &lt;hostdev/&gt; element. Both have their
          disadvantages: the former adds latency of file system and block
          layers of the host kernel, the latter prohibits domain migration. In
          this release the third way of configuring NVMe disk is added which
          combines the advantages and drops disadvantages of the previous two
          ways. It's accessible via &lt;disk type='nvme'/&gt;.

        <description>
          When using the xz format to compressed virtual
          machine saved state images, the "-3" compression
          level preset is now used. This results in slightly
          larger files, but with a massively reduced time
          to compress. The xz format offers the best compression
          level for saved state images, albeit still with the
          slowest running time. For the fastest possible
          running time, at cost of the larest compressed size,
          lzop should be used.

          addresses would be generated: one for the live configuration, which
          would show up immediately, and one for the inactive configuration,
          which would show up after the first reboot. This situation was
          clearly undesirable, so a single MAC address is now generated and
          used both for the live configuration and the inactive one.

          Until now, GPU mediated devices generally did not show any output

          a boot display for the device: this allows for display of firmware
          messages, boot loader menu, and other output before the guest OS has
          initialized the vGPU.

        <description>
          By default, when a command is sent to the guest agent, libvirt waits
          forever for a response from the guest agent. If the guest is
          unresponsive for any reason, this can block the calling thread
          indefinitely. By setting a custom timeout using
          <code>virDomainAgentSetResponseTimeout()</code>, API users can change
          this behavior.

          Libvirt used Perl scripts to check for coding style, generate some
          code and things like that. To bring the number of languages used
          down, these scripts were rewritten into Python.

          domain is started with it. If user shuts the domain down and the

          it never remembered the original labels and therefore
          the file was returned back to <code>root:root</code>.
          With this release, the original labels are remembered
          and restored properly.

          In some cases, a guest might be assigned a new IP address by DHCP

          will correctly report both addresses; many applications, however,
          ignore all addresses but the first, and may thus end up trying to
          connect using a stale address. To prevent that from happening, the
          NSS plugin will now always report the newest address first.

          Libvirt allows users to provide loader path for some time now.

          ships firmware description files this burden can be moved onto
          libvirt. It is as easy as setting the <code>firmware</code>
          attribute in the <code>os</code> element (accepted values are
          <code>bios</code> and <code>efi</code>). Moreover, libvirt
          automatically enables domain features needed for firmware it

          Don't default to building the QEMU driver
        </summary>
        <description>
          Historically, the QEMU driver has been special in that it was
          enabled by default, with the option to explicitly opt-out of it;
          starting now, we're enabling it opportunistically if we detect that
          all requirements are available, just like we do with other drivers.

          It's now possible to prevent libvirt from automatically adding a
          USB mouse to pSeries guests by including a USB tablet in the input
          XML: doing so is desiderable as using a tablet results in a much
          better user experience when working with GUIs.

          Historically firewall rules for virtual networks were added

          migrated too or be accessible from a network filesystem. CEPH
          and GPFS weren't detected as a network filesystem.

          qemu: Allocate memory at the configured NUMA nodes from start
        </summary>
        <description>
          Libvirt used to just start QEMU, let it allocate memory for
          the guest, and then use CGroups to move the memory to
          configured NUMA nodes. This is suboptimal as huge chunks of
          memory have to be moved. Moreover, this relies on ability to
          move memory later which is not always true. A change was made
          to set process affinity correctly from the start so that memory
          is allocated on the configured nodes from the beginning.

          network: Fix virtual networks on systems using firewalld+nftables
        </summary>
        <description>
          Because of the transitional state of firewalld's new support
          for nftables, not all iptables features required by libvirt
          are yet available, so libvirt must continue to use iptables
          for its own packet filtering rules even when the firewalld
          backend is set to use nftables. However, due to the way
          iptables support is implemented in kernels using nftables
          (iptables rules are converted to nftables rules and
          processed in a separate hook from the native nftables
          rules), guest networking was broken on hosts with firewalld
          configured to use nftables as the backend. This has been
          fixed by putting libvirt-managed bridges in their own
          firewalld zone, so that guest traffic can be forwarded
          beyond the host and host services can be exposed to guests
          on the virtual network without opening up those same
          services to the rest of the physical network. This means
          that host access from virtual machines is no longer
          controlled by the firewalld default zone (usually "public"),
          but rather by the new firewalld zone called "libvirt"
          (unless configured otherwise using the new zone
          attribute of the network bridge element).

          The pvops Linux kernel uses soft reset to handle the crash
          machine operation. The libxl driver now supports the soft
          reset shutdown event, allowing proper crash handling of
          pvops-based HVM domains.

          security: Fix permissions for UNIX sockets

        <description>
          Since 4.5.0, libvirt is using FD passing to hand sockets over to
          QEMU, which in theory removes the need for them to be accessible by
          the user under which the QEMU process is running; however, other
          processes such as vdsm need to access the sockets as well, which
          means adjusting permissions is still necessary.

        </summary>
        <description>
          It's now possible to use the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag together with
          VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK. The connection is then secured using the
          TLS environment which is setup for the migration connection.

          The VM Generatation ID exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically
          random, integer value identifier, referred to as a Globally
          Unique Identifier (GUID) to the guest in order to notify the
          guest operating system when the virtual machine is executed
          with a different configuration. Add a new domain XML processing
          and a domain capabilities feature.

          The CPU model presented to Xen HVM domains is equivalent to libvirt's
          host-passthrough model, although individual features can be enabled
          and disabled via the cpuid setting. The libvirt libxl driver now
          supports enabling and disabling individual features of the
          host-passthrough CPU model.

        <description>
          When starting a domain with a disk backed by a device
          mapper volume libvirt also needs to allow the storage
          backing the device mapper in CGroups. In the past
          kernel did not care, but starting from 4.16 CGroups are
          consulted on each access to the device mapper target.

          Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight
        </summary>
        <description>
          The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain
          scheduler weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided
          <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;cputune&gt;</code>. The
          driver now honors <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code>, and defers setting
          a default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any
          domains started after this improvement will have one fourth the
          shares of previously started domains. If all domains must have
          equal CPU shares, administrators must manually set the weight of
          previously started domains to 256, or restart them.

          qemu: TLS migration now enforces use of TLS for the NBD connection

        <description>
          When the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag was used with the migration API libvirt
          did not ensure that the NBD connection was using TLS as well. The code
          now rejects such migration as the TLS transport for NBD is not ready
          yet, but prevents a false sense of security that TLS would be used.
          The support TLS for NBD will be added soon.

          PCI devices may have other nested capabilities, like SRIOV and mdev

          it. It is useful to process kernel dump with KASLR enabled,
          and also provides various kernel details to crash tools.

          vbox: Add support for configuring storage controllers

        <description>
          The VirtualBox driver now supports the <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code>
          element in the domain XML for configuring storage controllers in VBOX
          VMs.  Additionally, libvirt's domain XML schema was updated to allow
          optional <code>model</code> attribute for <code>&lt;controller
              type='ide'&gt;</code> which is used by the VBOX driver to set the
          IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
          'ich6'.  Finally, with this change <code>dumpxml</code> generates
          <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code> elements that correspond to current
          VBOX VM storage controller configuration.

          vbox: Add support for attaching SAS storage controllers

        <description>
          In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas
          libvirt does not make such distinction. Therefore, the VBOX driver was
          updated to allow attaching SAS controllers via <code>&lt;controller
              type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'&gt;</code> element. If there are
          both SCSI and SAS controllers present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML
          can associate the disk device using the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
          element with the <code>controller</code> attribute, and optionally,
          set the port via <code>unit</code> attribute.

          Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu

        <description>
          Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption
          of disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the
          feature was turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing
          of those disks in qemu so that the image locking is not applied in
          that case. Additionally libvirt now checks that shareable disks have
          supported format (raw) to avoid metadata corruption.

          Instead it properly assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the
          order of appearance.

        <description>
          Starting with QEMU 2.10, disk images and NVRAM files get
          automatically locked to prevent them from being corrupted; however,
          file locking needs to be explicitly allowed through
          <code>virt-aa-helper</code> or AppArmor will reject the requests and
          the guest will not be able to run.

          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the

          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

          binary distributions don't have to compromise on shipping the storage

          nodedev: Fabric name must not be required for fc_host capability
        </summary>
        <description>
          fabric_name is one of many fc_host attributes in Linux that is
          optional and left to the low-level driver to decide if it is
          implemented. For example the zfcp device driver does not provide a
          fabric name for an fcp host. The requirement for the existence of
          a fabric name has been removed by making it optional.

          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        </summary>
        <description>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by

          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from

          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.
