# NB we don't use socket activation. When libvirtd starts it will
# spawn any virtual machines registered for autostart. We want this
# to occur on every boot, regardless of whether any client connects
# to a socket. Thus socket activation doesn't have any benefit

# At least 1 FD per guest, often 2 (eg qemu monitor + qemu agent).
# eg if we want to support 4096 guests, we'll typically need 8192 FDs
# If changing this, also consider virtlogd.service & virtlockd.service
# limits which are also related to number of guests
LimitNOFILE=8192
# The cgroups pids controller can limit the number of tasks started by
# the daemon, which can limit the number of domains for some hypervisors.
# A conservative default of 8 tasks per guest results in a TasksMax of
# 32k to support 4096 guests.
