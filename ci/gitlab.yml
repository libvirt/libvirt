# Variables that can be set to control the behaviour of
# pipelines that are run
#
#  - RUN_PIPELINE - force creation of a CI pipeline when
#    pushing to a branch in a forked repository. Official
#    CI pipelines are triggered when merge requests are
#    created/updated. Setting this variable to a non-empty
#    value allows CI testing prior to opening a merge request.
#
#  - RUN_PIPELINE_UPSTREAM_ENV - same semantics as RUN_PIPELINE,
#    but uses the CI environment (containers) from the upstream project
#    rather than creating and updating a throwaway environment
#    Should not be used if the pushed branch includes CI container
#    changes.
#
#  - RUN_CONTAINER_BUILDS - CI pipelines in upstream only
#    publish containers if CI file changes are detected.
#    Setting this variable to a non-empty value will force
#    re-publishing, even when no file changes are detected.
#    Typically to use from a scheduled job once a month.
#
#  - RUN_UPSTREAM_NAMESPACE - the upstream namespace is
#    configured to default to 'libvirt'. When testing
#    changes to CI it might be useful to use a different
#    upstream. Setting this variable will override the
#    namespace considered to be upstream.
#
# These can be set as git push options
#
#  $ git push -o ci.variable=RUN_PIPELINE=1
#
# Aliases can be set for common usage
#
#  $ git config --local alias.push-ci "push -o ci.variable=RUN_PIPELINE=1"
#
# Allowing the less verbose invocation
#
#  $ git push-ci
#
# Pipeline variables can also be set in the repository
# pipeline config globally, or set against scheduled pipelines
