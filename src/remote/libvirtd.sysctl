# The kernel allocates aio memory on demand, and this number limits the
# number of parallel aio requests; the only drawback of a larger limit is
# that a malicious guest could issue parallel requests to cause the kernel
# to set aside memory.  Set this number at least as large as
#   128 * (number of virtual disks on the host)
# Libvirt uses a default of 1M requests to allow 8k disks, with at most
# 64M of kernel memory if all disks hit an aio request at the same time.
