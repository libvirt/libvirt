=head1 NAME

libvirtd - libvirtd management daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<libvirtd> [I<OPTION>]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<libvirtd> program is the server side daemon component of the libvirt
virtualization management system.

This daemon runs on host servers and performs required management tasks for
virtualized guests.  This includes activities such as starting, stopping
and migrating guests between host servers, configuring and manipulating
networking, and managing storage for use by guests.

The libvirt client libraries and utilities connect to this daemon to issue
tasks and collect information about the configuration and resources of the host
system and guests.

By default, the libvirtd daemon listens for requests on a local Unix domain
socket.  Using the B<-l>|B<--listen> command line option, the libvirtd daemon
can be instructed to additionally listen on a TCP/IP socket.  The TCP/IP socket
to use is defined in the libvirtd configuration file.

Restarting libvirtd does not impact running guests.  Guests continue to operate
and will be picked up automatically if their XML configuration has been
defined.  Any guests whose XML configuration has not been defined will be lost
from the configuration.
