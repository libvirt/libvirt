# At least 1 FD per guest, often 2 (eg qemu monitor + qemu agent).
# eg if we want to support 4096 guests, we'll typically need 8192 FDs
# If changing this, also consider virtlogd.service & virtlockd.service
# limits which are also related to number of guests

# The cgroups pids controller can limit the number of tasks started by
# the daemon, which can limit the number of domains for some hypervisors.
# A conservative default of 8 tasks per guest results in a TasksMax of
# 32k to support 4096 guests.
TasksMax=32768
# With cgroups v2 there is no devices controller anymore, we have to use
# eBPF to control access to devices.  In order to do that we create a eBPF
# hash MAP which locks memory.  The default map size for 64 devices together
# with program takes 12k per guest.  After rounding up we will get 64M to
# support 4096 guests.
