# Logging controls
#

# Logging level: 4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug
# basically 1 will log everything possible
#
# WARNING: USE OF THIS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
#
# WARNING: It outputs too much information to practically read.
# WARNING: The "log_filters" setting is recommended instead.
#
# WARNING: Journald applies rate limiting of messages and so libvirt
# WARNING: will limit "log_level" to only allow values 3 or 4 if
# WARNING: journald is the current output.
#
# WARNING: USE OF THIS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
#log_level = 3

# Logging filters:
# A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
# of logs. The format for a filter is:
#
#    level:match
#
# where 'match' is a string which is matched against the category
# given in the VIR_LOG_INIT() at the top of each libvirt source
# file, e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util.json". The 'match' in the
# filter matches using shell wildcard syntax (see 'man glob(7)').
# The 'match' is always treated as a substring match. IOW a match
# string 'foo' is equivalent to '*foo*'.
#
# 'level' is the minimal level where matching messages should
#  be logged:
#
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple filters can be defined in a single @log_filters, they just need
# to be separated by spaces. Note that libvirt performs "first" match, i.e.
# if there are concurrent filters, the first one that matches will be applied,
# given the order in @log_filters.
#
# For the virtlogd daemon, a typical need is to capture information
# from the logging code and some of the utility code. Some utility
# code is very verbose and is generally not desired. A suitable filter
# string for debugging might be to turn off object, json & event logging,
# but enable the rest of the util and the logging code:
#
#log_filters="1:logging 4:object 4:json 4:event 1:util"

# Logging outputs:
# An output is one of the places to save logging information
# The format for an output can be:
#    level:stderr
#      output goes to stderr
#    level:syslog:name
#      use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident
#    level:file:file_path
#      output to a file, with the given filepath
#    level:journald
#      output to journald logging system
# In all cases 'level' is the minimal priority, acting as a filter
#    1: DEBUG
#    2: INFO
#    3: WARNING
#    4: ERROR
#
# Multiple outputs can be defined, they just need to be separated by spaces.
# e.g. to log all warnings and errors to syslog under the virtlogd ident:
#log_outputs="3:syslog:virtlogd"
#

# The maximum number of concurrent client connections to allow
# on primary socket
#max_clients = 1024

# The maximum number of concurrent client connections to allow
# on administrative socket
#admin_max_clients = 5

# Maximum file size before rolling over. Defaults to 2 MB
#
# Beware that a logrotate config file might be installed too,
# to handle cases where virtlogd is disabled. To ensure that
# the logrotate config is a no-op when virtlogd is running,
# make sure that max_size here is smaller than size listed
# in the logrotate config.
#max_size = 2097152

# Maximum number of backup files to keep. Defaults to 3,
# not including the primary active file
#max_backups = 3
