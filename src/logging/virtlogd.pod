=head1 NAME

virtlogd - libvirt log management daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<virtlogd> [I<OPTION>]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<virtlogd> program is a server side daemon component of the libvirt
virtualization management system that is used to manage logs from virtual
machine consoles.

This daemon is not used directly by libvirt client applications, rather it
is called on their behalf by B<libvirtd>. By maintaining the logs in a
standalone daemon, the main libvirtd daemon can be restarted without risk
of losing logs. The B<virtlogd> daemon has the ability to re-exec()
itself upon receiving SIGUSR1, to allow live upgrades without downtime.

The virtlogd daemon listens for requests on a local Unix domain socket.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h, --help>

Display command line help usage then exit.

=item B<-d, --daemon>

Run as a daemon and write PID file.

=item B<-f, --config> I<FILE>

Use this configuration file, overriding the default value.

=item B<-t, --timeout> I<SECONDS>

Automatically shutdown after I<SECONDS> have elapsed with
no active console log.

=item B<-p, --pid-file> I<FILE>

Use this name for the PID file, overriding the default value.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Enable output of verbose messages.

=item B<-V, --version>

Display version information then exit.

=head1 SIGNALS

On receipt of B<SIGUSR1> virtlogd will re-exec() its binary, while
maintaining all current logs and clients. This allows for live
upgrades of the virtlogd service.

=head1 FILES

=head2 When run as B<root>.

=over

=item F<SYSCONFDIR/libvirt/virtlogd.conf>

The default configuration file used by virtlogd, unless overridden on the
command line using the B<-f>|B<--config> option.

=item F<LOCALSTATEDIR/run/libvirt/virtlogd-sock>

The sockets libvirtd will use.

=item F<LOCALSTATEDIR/run/virtlogd.pid>

The PID file to use, unless overridden by the B<-p>|B<--pid-file> option.

=back

=head2 When run as B<non-root>.

=over

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/libvirt/virtlogd.conf>

The default configuration file used by libvirtd, unless overridden on the
command line using the B<-f>|B<--config> option.

=item F<$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/libvirt/virtlogd-sock>

The socket libvirtd will use.

=item F<$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/libvirt/virtlogd.pid>

The PID file to use, unless overridden by the B<-p>|B<--pid-file> option.

=item If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set in your environment, libvirtd will use F<$HOME/.config>

=item If $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set in your environment, libvirtd will use F<$HOME/.cache>

=head1 EXAMPLES

To retrieve the version of virtlogd:

 # virtlogd --version
 virtlogd (libvirt) 1.1.1
 #

To start virtlogd, instructing it to daemonize and create a PID file:

 # virtlogd -d
 # ls -la LOCALSTATEDIR/run/virtlogd.pid
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6 Jul  9 02:40 LOCALSTATEDIR/run/virtlogd.pid
 #
