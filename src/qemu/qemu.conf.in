# The libvirt QEMU driver supports serveral different save image formats.
# The term "format" is used loosely to describe how the save image data is
# represented on disk. It could be a continguous stream of guest memory blocks,
# or a stream of compressed memory blocks.
#
# A continguous stream of guest memory blocks is the default format for QEMU/KVM
# guest save images and is termed "raw". The raw format can consume considerable
# disk space when saving large memory guests. Various compression formats are
# available for specifying a save image compressed by the named algorithm.
# Supported compression formats are "zstd", "lzop", "gzip", "bzip2", and "xz".
# The "sparse" format uses QEMU's mapped-ram stream format to write guest memory
# blocks at fixed offsets in the save image file.

# save_image_format can be used to select the desired save format. "raw" is
# the traditional format used by libvirt and is also the default. The
# compression formats can be used to save disk space, although this typically
# results in longer save and restore times. The "sparse" format results in a
# save image file that is roughly the logical size of the guest's memory,
# although on-disk size is a function of guest memory usage. The "sparse"
# format is useful when a predictable maximum save image file size is
# needed. The other formats can result in a save image file much larger
# than guest memory if the guest runs a memory intensive workload.
#
# save_image_format is used with 'virsh save' or 'virsh managedsave'. It is
# an error if the specified save_image_format is not valid, or cannot be
# supported by the system.
#
# dump_image_format is analogous to save_image_format and is used with
# 'virsh dump' at emergency crashdump. If the specified dump_image_format is
# not valid or cannot be supported by the system, this falls back to the
# "raw" format.
#
# Likewise, snapshot_image_format specifies the format of the memory save
# image when an external snapshot of a domain is taken. This does not apply
# on disk image format. It is an error if the specified format isn't valid,
# or the system cannot support the requested format.

# This allows qemu driver to detect broken connections to remote

# to check if the daemon is still responding; keepalive_count is a
# maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent
# to the daemon without getting any response before the connection
# is considered broken.  In other words, the connection is
# automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the daemon.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, qemu driver will not send keepalive requests during
# peer-to-peer migration; however, the remote libvirtd can still

# Later, when libvirt creates per domain variable store, this list is
# searched for the master image. The UEFI firmware can be called

# Possible options are:
# "none"   - (default) qemu is supposed to accept and output deprecated fields

# "omit"   - qemu is instructed to omit deprecated fields on output, behaviour
#            towards fields and commands from qemu is not changed

# For both "reject" and "crash" qemu is instructed to omit any deprecated fields

# The "reject" option is less harsh towards the VMs but some code paths ignore

# command/field was used, thus it's suggested to use the "crash" option instead.
