# Keepalive protocol:
# This allows qemu driver to detect broken connections to remote
# libvirtd during peer-to-peer migration.  A keepalive message is
# sent to the daemon after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity
# to check if the daemon is still responding; keepalive_count is a
# maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent
# to the daemon without getting any response before the connection
# is considered broken.  In other words, the connection is
# automatically closed approximately after
# keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1) seconds since the last
# message received from the daemon.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, qemu driver will not send keepalive requests during
# peer-to-peer migration; however, the remote libvirtd can still
# send them and source libvirtd will send responses.  When
# keepalive_count is set to 0, connections will be automatically
# closed after keepalive_interval seconds of inactivity without
# sending any keepalive messages.

# This configuration option is obsolete. Libvirt will follow the

# When a domain is configured to use UEFI instead of standard
# BIOS it may use a separate storage for UEFI variables. If
# that's the case libvirt creates the variable store per domain
# using this master file as image. Each UEFI firmware can,
# however, have different variables store. Therefore the nvram is
# a list of strings when a single item is in form of:
#   ${PATH_TO_UEFI_FW}:${PATH_TO_UEFI_VARS}.
# Later, when libvirt creates per domain variable store, this list is
# searched for the master image. The UEFI firmware can be called
# differently for different guest architectures. For instance, it's OVMF
# for x86_64 and i686, but it's AAVMF for aarch64. The libvirt default
# follows this scheme.

#
#  'logd': QEMU writes to a pipe provided by virtlogd daemon.

#          rollover when a size limit is hit.

# 'deprecation_behavior' setting controls how the qemu process behaves towards

#
# This setting is meant for developers and CI efforts to make it obvious when
# libvirt relies on fields which are deprecated so that it can be fixes as soon
# as possible.
#
# Possible options are:
# "none"   - (default) qemu is supposed to accept and output deprecated fields
#            and commands
# "omit"   - qemu is instructed to omit deprecated fields on output, behaviour
#            towards fields and commands from qemu is not changed
# "reject" - qemu is instructed to report an error if a deprecated command or
#            field is used by libvirtd
# "crash"  - qemu crashes when an deprecated command or field is used by libvirtd
#
# For both "reject" and "crash" qemu is instructed to omit any deprecated fields
# on output.
#
# The "reject" option is less harsh towards the VMs but some code paths ignore
# errors reported by qemu and thus it may not be obvious that a deprecated
# command/field was used, thus it's suggested to use the "crash" option instead.
#
# In cases when qemu doesn't support configuring the behaviour this setting is
# silently ignored to allow testing older qemu versions without having to
