# message received from the daemon.  If keepalive_interval is set to
# -1, qemu driver will not send keepalive requests during

# Location of master nvram file
#
# When a domain is configured to use UEFI instead of standard
# BIOS it may use a separate storage for UEFI variables. If
# that's the case libvirt creates the variable store per domain
# using this master file as image. Each UEFI firmware can,
# however, have different variables store. Therefore the nvram is
# a list of strings when a single item is in form of:
#   ${PATH_TO_UEFI_FW}:${PATH_TO_UEFI_VARS}.
# Later, when libvirt creates per domain variable store, this list is
# searched for the master image. The UEFI firmware can be called
# differently for different guest architectures. For instance, it's OVMF
# for x86_64 and i686, but it's AAVMF for aarch64. The libvirt default
# follows this scheme.

#  'file': QEMU writes directly to a plain file. This is the
#          historical default, but allows QEMU to inflict a
#          denial of service attack on the host by exhausting
#          filesystem space
#
#  'logd': QEMU writes to a pipe provided by virtlogd daemon.
#          This is the current default, providing protection
#          against denial of service by performing log file
#          rollover when a size limit is hit.

# To enhance security, QEMU driver is capable of creating private namespaces

# devices entries throughout the domain lifetime. This namespace is turned on
# by default.
