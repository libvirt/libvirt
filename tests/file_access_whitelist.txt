# This is a whitelist that allows accesses to files not in our
# build directory nor source directory. The records are in the
# following formats:
#
#  $path: $progname: $testname
#  $path: $action: $progname: $testname
#
# All these variables are evaluated as perl RE. So to allow
# /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, you can just '/dev/sd[a-b]', or to allow
# /proc/$pid/status you can '/proc/\d+/status' and so on.
# Moreover, $action, $progname and $testname can be empty, in which
# which case $path is allowed for all tests. However, $action (if
# specified) must be one of "open", "fopen", "access", "stat",
# "lstat", "connect".
