   virnetservertest data files
   ===========================

The various input-data-*.json files are a record of all the historical
formats that libvirt has been able to produce data for. Every time a
new field is added to the JSON output, a *new* input data file should
be created. We must not add new fields to existing input-data files,
nor must we ever re-structure them if code changes, as we must check
new code handles the legacy formats.

The various output-data-*.json files are the record of what the *new*
JSON output should look like for the correspondingly named input-data
file. It is permissible to change the existing output-data-*.json
files if the format we save in is updated.
