# UNIX socket access controls

#
# This is restricted to 'root' by default.

# Set the UNIX socket permissions for the R/O socket. This is used

#
# Default allows any user. If setting group ownership may want to
# restrict this to:

# Set the UNIX socket permissions for the R/W socket. This is used
# for full management of VMs
#
# Default allows only root. If PolicyKit is enabled on the socket,

# Authentication.
#
#  - none: do not perform auth checks. If you can connect to the
#          socket you are allowed. This is suitable if there are
#          restrictions on connecting to the socket (eg, UNIX
#          socket permissions), or if there is a lower layer in
#          the network providing auth (eg, TLS/x509 certificates)
#
#  - sasl: use SASL infrastructure. The actual auth scheme is then
#          controlled from /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf. For the TCP
#          socket only GSSAPI & DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms will be used.
#          For non-TCP or TLS sockets,  any scheme is allowed.
#
#  - polkit: use PolicyKit to authenticate. This is only suitable
#            for use on the UNIX sockets. The default policy will
#            require a user to supply their own password to gain
#            full read/write access (aka sudo like), while anyone
#            is allowed read/only access.
#
# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-only sockets
# By default socket permissions allow anyone to connect
#
# To restrict monitoring of domains you may wish to enable
# an authentication mechanism here
auth_unix_ro = "none"

# Set an authentication scheme for UNIX read-write sockets
# By default socket permissions only allow root. If PolicyKit
# support was compiled into libvirt, the default will be to
# use 'polkit' auth.
#
# If the unix_sock_rw_perms are changed you may wish to enable
# an authentication mechanism here
auth_unix_rw = "none"

# Change the authentication scheme for TCP sockets.
#
# If you don't enable SASL, then all TCP traffic is cleartext.
# Don't do this outside of a dev/test scenario. For real world
# use, always enable SASL and use the GSSAPI or DIGEST-MD5
# mechanism in /etc/sasl2/libvirt.conf
auth_tcp = "sasl"

# Change the authentication scheme for TLS sockets.
#
# TLS sockets already have encryption provided by the TLS
# layer, and limited authentication is done by certificates
#
# It is possible to make use of any SASL authentication
# mechanism as well, by using 'sasl' for this option
